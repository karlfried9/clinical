Purpose of this Rail App
=========================
This rais application will be used by Oncologists (cancer doctors) participate in Cancer 
drug/therapy trials to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug.  Typical use of this application is
to record a doctor's interaction with a cancer patient where the patient is given a cancer drug
and the patient progress is monitored over-time to see if the cancer drug being researched is better
than other alternatives.  So at the core, the application is recording "Patient Activities"

Genarally, drug trials require four participants: 
1) The Sponsor - typically a drug company who has been researching a molecule for a long time, has done some trials on
animals to see if it works and are ready to have trials on humans with the given disease/cancer).  Sponsors have to
finance all the expenses for drug trials and these could be USD 10 Million or up to USD 200 Million.  The money goes to pay
everyone who is involved, but everyone maintains strict independence from the sponsor.

2) The Investigator - an independent doctor or a researcher who will independently validaet the claims of the drugs.  They
will setup the trial, criteria to select patients, e.g., if the trial is for early stage liver cancer, 
then the volunteers should have liver cancer Stage 1 or 2, should be adults, not pregnant and between the age of 35-55.
The Investigator will oversee the cancerl doctors at many clinics who will be interacting with the patients.  Investigators
will also "compile" the research data and in teh end, be responsible for the results.  So this is a big job.  Only the most
respected doctors with a LOT of experience who are typically very senior people at big hospitals become investigators.  Trials
typically have primary and secondary investigators

3) Doctors - who are selected by the investigators to participante in the trial and who will find patients and recommend to patients
to participate in the drug trial if it is applicable in their cases.  These doctors
will be paid by the sponsor but will maintain 100% independence.  We do not want anyone being influenced by money when
peoples lives and healths are the topic.  So these doctors get paid for all expenses regardless of the success of the drug

3) The Cancer Patient - who will try out the drug, patients do this because they expect to that new drug being tried could 
improve their lives or hope that the drug will help them live longer (e.g., this new drug can give you more time to live by slowing down cancer progress).
In some cases the patients get compensated for their time, but the key motivator for cancer drug trials is an issue of living longer,
which could be months... so its very sad...

Primary User
============
Our user is the Doctor who sees a patient.  So they will use our app to do the following

1- Enter patient Activity (e.g. patient P1 who is participating in clinical trial C2 came in today, and they were given drug X.  This activity
costs $200 USD. And a prescription to other medication was written)
2- Setup new patient who came in the first time, when this patient comes in for a follow up then the previous activity applies
3- Create an invoice which "bundles" several Activities together; invoicing will then have a workflow, e.g. invoice generated, invoice sent,
invoice paid, etc.
4- Enter a clinical trial information for a new trial i will be running and looking for patients (also enter a new sponsor if doesn't exist in the database)
5- Other setup tasks - setup Activity Codes and prices (like a menu in restaurant)
